This is old project and I only recently started using Git as my portfolio. This sudoku implements backtrack algorithm to solve the problem

## Introduction
Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (called "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Setup
1. The puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 regions.
2. Some cells in the grid are pre-filled with numbers from 1 to 9.
3. The goal is to fill the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9 following the rules.

## Playing the Game
1. Start with a partially filled 9x9 grid.
2. The grid contains several numbers (given as clues) and some empty cells.
3. The player's task is to complete the grid, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9.

## Rules
1. Each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating any digit.
2. Each column must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating any digit.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (regions) must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating any digit.
4. The puzzle initially provides a few numbers as clues. These numbers cannot be changed.
5. To solve the puzzle, use logic and deduction to fill in the remaining empty cells.
